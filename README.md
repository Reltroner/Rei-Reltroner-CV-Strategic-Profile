# 📄 Rei Reltroner – CV & Strategic Profile

Welcome to my official CV repository. This document is more than just a résumé — it's a distilled reflection of my system-building journey, from the abyss of failure to the architecture of clarity.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I’m Rei Reltroner — a clarity-oriented system builder, fullstack developer, and founder of **Reltroner Studio**. I create digital ecosystems powered by **Next.js (SSR)**, **Laravel 12**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and structured worldbuilding logic.

More than technical skill, I bring **philosophy, precision, and resilience** into every project — forged through deep volatility, rebuilt with red-pill discipline.
